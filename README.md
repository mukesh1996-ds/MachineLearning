# MachineLearning

In this project I will be using modular mechanism of code. Here are the steps that are followed:

1. Creating `template.py` file for creating folders and respective files that are used.
2. creating an environment:
    * conda create -p env python=3.9 -y
    * conda activate env/
    * pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Creating a setup file using `setup.py` and the reason for this is that `its a module used to build and distribute Python packages. This will also capture name, version and dependencies as well as instructions for building and installing the package.`


Certainly! Below is a detailed explanation of each stage in a typical machine learning project pipeline:

### Stage 1: Data Storage Directory
**Description**: In this stage, you establish a directory or storage location for your project data. This could be on a cloud platform like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, or it could be a local directory on your machine or server.

**Purpose**: Centralizing data storage ensures easy access and management of datasets throughout the project lifecycle.

### Stage 2: Data Extraction
**Description**: Data extraction involves retrieving raw data from various sources such as databases, APIs, CSV files, or other data repositories.

**Purpose**: Obtaining the necessary data for analysis and model training is crucial for building effective machine learning models.

### Stage 3: Data Preparation
**Description**: Data preparation involves cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling. This may include tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

**Purpose**: High-quality data is essential for training accurate and robust machine learning models. Data preparation ensures that the data is consistent, relevant, and ready for modeling.

### Stage 4: Model Training
**Description**: Model training involves selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm, fitting the model to the training data, and optimizing its parameters using techniques such as cross-validation or hyperparameter tuning.

**Purpose**: The goal of model training is to build a predictive model that can generalize well to unseen data and make accurate predictions or classifications.

### Stage 5: Model Evaluation
**Description**: Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc., depending on the nature of the problem (classification, regression, etc.).

**Purpose**: Evaluating the model helps determine its effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. It also helps in comparing different models and selecting the best-performing one.

### Stage 6: Model Validation
**Description**: Model validation involves testing the trained model on an independent dataset (validation set) to ensure its generalization capability and assess its performance in real-world scenarios.

**Purpose**: Model validation helps detect overfitting or underfitting issues and provides an estimate of the model's performance in production environments.

### Stage 7: Pipeline Deployment
**Description**: Pipeline deployment involves deploying the trained model into a production environment where it can be used to make predictions or classifications on new incoming data.

**Purpose**: Deploying the model enables real-time inference and integration with other systems or applications, allowing stakeholders to leverage the model's predictions for decision-making purposes.

By following these stages in your machine learning project pipeline, you can effectively manage and execute each step of the workflow, leading to the development of accurate and reliable machine learning models.
