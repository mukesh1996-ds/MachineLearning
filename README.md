# MachineLearning

In this project I will be using modular mechanism of code. Here are the steps that are followed:

1. Creating `template.py` file for creating folders and respective files that are used.
2. creating an environment:
    * conda create -p env python=3.9 -y
    * conda activate env/
    * pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Creating a setup file using `setup.py` and the reason for this is that `its a module used to build and distribute Python packages. This will also capture name, version and dependencies as well as instructions for building and installing the package.`
